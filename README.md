# etch-a-sketch
My Etch-A-Sketch project
This project took me a long time, but I finished. solidified a lot of my learning from The Odin Project. I now have a greater understanding on how to manipulate html elements via the DOM, I also learned a lot about loops, arrays and figuring out the difference between an html collection, nodelist, and an array. This project definitely challenged me. But it was doable.
